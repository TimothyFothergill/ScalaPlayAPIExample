# ScalaPlayAPIExample 

My first attempt at writing a full Scala Play project, from creation using `SBT` through to deployment.


## My Learning Process
### Getting Started

Using IntelliJ IDEA as my IDE of choice.\
Following the documentation on https://playframework.com, ran the following command:\
`sbt new playframework/play-scala-seed.g8`

This creates a new Scala Play project using SBT (Scala Build Tool).\
Created git repository and pushed initial build to `main` branch. \
`git checkout` to create a new branch and began the initial build.
